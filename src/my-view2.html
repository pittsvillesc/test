                        <p>Teams must register and pay all team fees to participate in the tournament. Fees must be paid prior to the first match.  Any team or player determined by the Tournament Director to have falsified age or skill level could be dismissed from the tournament.
                        <p>Divisions will be determined by the age and experience of the players.
                        <p>We encourage teams to be co-ed, not male only.  All-female teams may register but there is no guarantee that there will be a female division in any given age group.  If there are at least 2 all-female teams in a division, there will be a girls championship.
                        <p>Players may register with more than one team, but scheduling conflicts must be handled by each individual team.

Additionally, teams must print out the participant waiver and submit the waiver form with all signatures during team check-in.  All players myst be listed on the Official Team Roster prior to the team's first scheduled match.  If there are changes in the roster from what was initially submitted, please communicate these changes at team check-in.</p>
                        <p>Five is the maximum number of players on each team's roster: three field players and two substitutes.  Teams are allowed less than six players if they choose.  A team must have a minimum of 2 field players.</p>

                    <dt>Kick-Ins</dt>
                    <dd>The ball shall be kicked into play from the sidelines, instead of thrown in.  There are no throw ins.</dd>

                    <dd>All dead-ball kicks (kick-ins, free kicks, kick offs) are indirect with the exception of penalty kicks</dd>
                    <dt>Corner Kicks</dt>

                    <dd>Shall be awarded if, in the referee's opinion, a scoring opportunity was nullified by an infraction.  Penalty kicks are DIRECT kicks taken from the center of the mid-line with all players (on both teams) behind the mid-line.  Penalty kicks are dead ball infractions.  If a goal is not scored, the defense obtains possession with a goal kick</dd>
                    <dt>Goal Scoring</dt>
                    <dd>A goal cannot be scored from an indirect kick, such as a kick-in from out-of-bounds.  Goals MUST be scored from the attacking half of the field.  Goals scored from behind the mid-line will result in a goal kick to the defending team.</dd>
                    <dt>Five Yard Rule</dt>
                    <dd>In all dead ball situations, defending players must stand at least five (5) yards away from the ball.  If the defensive player's goal is closer than five (5) yards, the ball shall be played five (5) yards from the goal, in line with the place of the infraction.</dd>
                    <dt>Goal Box</dt>
                    <dd>There are NO goalkeepers in 3 vs 3 soccer.  Defensive players may not play the ball in the Goal Box.  If a ball is played by a defender in the Goal Box, a goal will be awarded.  If an attacker plays the ball in the goal box, a goal kick will be awarded.  Players MAY move through the goal box.</dd>
                    <dt>Slide Tackling</dt>
                    <dd>Playing the ball while on the ground is not permitted with other players within striking distance.  This is considered "dangerous play" and will be called at the discretion of the referee.  Slide tackling infractions will result in an automatic yellow card.</dd>

                    <dd>
                        Deliberate handling of the ball that denies a team of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity may result in the following (at the discretion of the referee):
                        <ul>
                            <li>A penalty kick</li>

                    <dd>
                        A yellow/red card system will be used to control unsportsmanlike conduct and improper behavior.  Any player receiving two yellow cards during one game or a red card will be ejected and must sit out their team's next game.  Yellow/Red cards may be issued for the following:                        
                        <ul>
                            <b>Yellow Card</b>
